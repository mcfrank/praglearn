Code and simulations from Smith, Goodman, & Frank (2013) NIPS paper. 


### terrifying note from Smith (four years ago)

NOTE THAT THIS CODE AND PDFS ARE NOT ACTUALLY THE MODEL WE USED

In particular, uncertain_l_dist in conpact2.py here inverts a marginalization of the one-step-down speaker, while the submitted paper and figures used a version (still present, commented out, in uncertain_l_dist) that simply marginalizes over the same-level listener.

par/ does contain the proper code and figures.

also this version of the code and figures are available on a branch (l-marginalizing-over-s) which also contains the par/ and cross-sit.pdf files for the marginalizing version
